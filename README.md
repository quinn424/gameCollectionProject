Who are the users of the software?
People with large collections of games that want a simple way to add or remove titles.

What is the purpose of the software?
To remove and manage a large collection of games, although it can technically be used to manage other media if listed in the same format

Where and when will the software be used?
When a game needs its information to be quickly viewed.

How does the software work?
Through running the .java file, the user can use the interface to input the information about their games, leaving blank any information they are unsure of. 
The collection is saved as "gameCollection.csv" and can be backed up or cleared with a press of a button. 
They can also remove any game from the list by having their input matched to the closest result, skipping blank inputs.

Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?
For the specific ease of use of having all of the controls in one place when managing the collection with more options planned.
